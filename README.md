Passionate about biology and science, having obtained a solid education in genetics and cell biology, I expanded my professional development by switching to the field of computer science. Based on my laboratory experience, I have evolved into a competent and versatile web developer.

My shift to computer science has enabled me to merge my analytical skills and scientific rigor with the creativity and problem-solving inherent in web development. I am motivated by the idea of crafting innovative solutions using a pluridisciplinary approach, blending my knowledge in biology with my programming skills.

I am seeking professional opportunities where I can merge my passion for science and my technical expertise in web development to contribute to challenging and innovative projects
